# Welcome!
Thank you for your interest in Dashing! This exceptionally handsome
framework welcomes all input, but being stylish requires certain
protocols be followed. :bowtie:

Below you will find a set of guidelines that will ensure the best outcome
for you _and_ Dashing.

<a name="issues"></a>
## Have an Issue?
If you run into problems with Dashing, please take these steps before
submitting an issue:

1. Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki#how-tos) in the wiki.
2. Use the [GitHub Issue Search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) to check if the issue has already been reported.
3. Submit your issue to our Issue Tracker. Please provide as much helpful information as possible, preferably making use of a [reduced test case](https://www.google.ca/search?#q=reduced%20test%20case).

**Support requests should be directed to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dashing).**

<a name="features"></a>
## Feature Requests
Feature requests are welcome, but take a moment to consider whether your idea
fits with the scope and aim of the project. A good rule of thumb is to apply
the 80/20 rule: every feature should be useful to at least 80% of users. Adding
in every possible edge case will only make it more difficult to understand, maintain,
and hack on.

If you feel that you have a really amazing, super neato idea that doesn't
quite fit with the core use of Dashing, it may be a good candidate for an
external Gem which supercharges a project. An excellent example of this is
[dashing-contrib](https://github.com/QubitProducts/dashing-contrib). If you
do create a third-party extension for Dashing, please add it [here](https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets#other-third-party-tools).

## Pull Requests

Patches, improvements and new features are a fantastic
help -- thank you!

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that may
not be merged into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation,
accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).
All code submitted via Pull Request will be dicussed and critiqued in a
respectful manner.

GitHub has [excellent documentation on how to use Pull Requests.](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
